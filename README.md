## Overview
This project uses the YouTube API to collect and analyse data. The data collected covers the 100 most viewed videos in the years 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020. The next part of the project groups the videos by category and analyses likes and views of these over time. Finally, it analyses how the duration of the most viewed videos has varied over the years. 

This project was developed for Social Media Data Analysis course at the University of Catania (Accademic Year 2023-2024)

## Key Features 
The key features of this project are:

Most viewed videos and categories: Using one of the main methods of the YouTube API (search().list()) we take the list of the 100 most viewed videos for each year under consideration. We then group these videos according to their category and see for each year which catogories are the most popular, which have increased in importance over the years and which have decreased in importance.

Analysis of categories over the years: After seeing which are the best categories by views we take the most significant ones and see the trend of views and likes over the years.

Duration of videos: In conclusion we analyse the duration of the most viewed videos in each year, looking at the ‘Shorts’ case and how these have affected the average duration
